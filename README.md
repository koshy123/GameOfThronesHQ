### MVP/PostMVP

MVP- 
Will fetch data from the API with axios. After getting the data on the page, it will be passed down the child components. 
Will be able to cycle through the quotes and show info about who said the quote as well.

Post MVP- 
Have an input to guess the name of who said the quote and have it keep score if you got it correct.
There will also be another section about the new sequel show "House of the Dragon" which will pull from a custom made API.


### MVP EXAMPLE
- The axios fetch from Game of thrones API
- The state that is passed down from App.js to Quote.js
- The various components that are linked to each other with Router and Link

### PostMVP EXAMPLE
- An input that you can guess the name of who said the quote. It will increase score if you get it right. There will be a timer to see how many you can do within an alloted time period.

## Code Snippet
This is the code that allows me to click another random quote.

function nextQuote(){
  setQuote(!quote)
}

```


## Issues and Resolutions
- I had a big issue with how to pass down data to the children. The solution was that I was pulling the data from a child, and I needed to pull data in the App.js and then pass it down. 
- To start off I had issued with react-router and not being able to use the library. After restarting and installing, it was able to work properly. 

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**:  Failed to compile ./src/components/App/App.js Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-router-dom'.
**RESOLUTION**: Install and update react-router-dom
